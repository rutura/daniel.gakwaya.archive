      <h3> <a href="https://github.com/blikoon/QRCodeScanner">Android QR Code Scanner Library</a></h3>
      <h4>Lead Developer • 2017 — Present</h4>
      <p>This library was developed because we needed such a feature in Salama. Now building a library yourself is crasy right ? We built it because we needed to build some business around that technology in some near future. What better way to dive deep in the tech than building a library for that tech! Salama uses this library already and we are getting some early adpters using it now.</p>
